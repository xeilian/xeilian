### Hi there, welcome to my Github profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maxi, a history student currently studying at the University Heidelberg.

On this Github account, I will occasionally publish projects that i am working on.

My biggest project yet, my GIS-based Bachelor degree about the Swabian Children migration, is already [online](https://github.com/xeilian/schwabenkinder)!

Have fun, Maxi âœ¨
