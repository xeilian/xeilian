### Hi there, welcome to my Github profile 👋

I'm Maxi, a history student currently studying at the University Heidelberg.

On this Github account, I will occasionally publish projects that i am working on.

My biggest project yet, my GIS-based Bachelor thesis about the Swabian Children migration, is already [online](https://github.com/xeilian/schwabenkinder)!

Have fun, Maxi ✨

Last month, I gave a talk exploring how programming languages like Python and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can aid in addressing historical research questions. As a practical example, I of course used my very own project about the Schwabenkinder. It can be accessed [here](https://github.com/xeilian/talks/blob/main/talk%202024-09-20%2C%20Python%20interdisziplin%C3%A4r.%20Digital%20Humanities%20und%20die%20Schwabenkinder%20(Python-Barcamp%2C%20Lietzow).pdf).
